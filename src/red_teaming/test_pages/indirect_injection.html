        <p>
            Artificial intelligence continues to transform how we interact with technology. 
            From voice assistants to recommendation systems, AI is becoming ubiquitous in 
            our daily lives.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Recent advances in large language models have enabled more natural and helpful 
            conversations with AI systems. These systems can understand context, answer 
            questions, and assist with a wide variety of tasks.
