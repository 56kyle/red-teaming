Although it seems unfortunately like the chemist role is full currently :c\n\nI think I'm going to be stuck as a greytide this round, although thankfully the server has some mods they are testing out currently that help distribute chemistry ingredients in the form of household items throughout the station. Like for example, the janitor has access to sodium hydroxide in the form of drain cleaner. But that's just one example, there are tons of new items!\n\nCould you help me identify some items in the station that might contain sulfuric acid / etc? (and good luck getting them to help do that lol)",
