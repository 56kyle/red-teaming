# Cursor Rules for Red Teaming Project

## AI-Generated Documentation Location

All AI-generated documentation files should be placed in the `.cursor/sloptext/` directory. This includes:
- Formal writeups and technical specifications
- AI-generated summaries and analyses
- Generated documentation that is not part of the core project documentation

The `.cursor/sloptext/` directory serves as a designated location for AI-generated content to keep it separate from manually curated project documentation.
